usage: clearcache [OPTIONS] [TARGET(S)]

Selectively clears the pacman cache in /var/cache/pacman/pkg/. Keeps the two
most recent versions of each package.

 Options:
  -h, --help          display this help menu
  -d, --dry           dry run, simply list targets instead of removing
  -q, --quiet         only prints filenames for -d/--dry or -l/--list-targets
  -f, --force         force removal of package files
  -i, --ignore PKG    specify package(s) to ignore. this can be a comma
                      separated list, or '-' reads a list from stdin, one
                      per line. can be used more than once.
  -k, --keep NUM      specify number of old package files to keep. by default,
                      clearcache will keep the two most recent versions.
  -l, --list-targets  list targets to remove, using PAGER/less, before 
                      removing. may not be used with -d/--dry
  -t, --threads NUM   use NUM threads. the default value is the number of
                      cores your CPU has. Using a large number will not gain
                      you much, and is not recommended, but there is no hard
                      limit.
  -u, --uninstalled   remove all package files for packages that are not
                      currently installed, while still keeping the
                      specified number of old files for installed packages
  -v, --verbose       output more

 Targets:
  Targets are package names, as you would specify them to pacman.
  If targets are specified, only package files belonging to them will be
  removed. If no targets are specified, all packages except for those
  specified to be ignored will be removed.
